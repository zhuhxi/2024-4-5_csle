    RYU Controller implementing a learning L2 switch for OpenFlow 1.3 with the STP spanning tree protocol

    To avoid the problems associated with redundant links in a switched LAN,
    STP is implemented on switches to monitor the network topology. Every link between switches,
    and in particular redundant links, are catalogued.
    The spanning-tree algorithm then blocks forwarding on redundant links by setting up one preferred link
    between switches in the LAN. This preferred link is used for all Ethernet frames unless it fails,
    in which case a non-preferred redundant link is enabled. When implemented in a network,
    STP designates one layer-2 switch as root bridge. All switches then select their best connection
    towards the root bridge for forwarding and block other redundant links.
    All switches constantly communicate with their neighbors in the LAN using bridge protocol data units (BPDUs)
