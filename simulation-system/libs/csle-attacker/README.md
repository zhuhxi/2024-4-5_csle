pip install csle-attacker==<version>
# local install from source
$ pip install -e csle-attacker
# or (equivalently):
make install
# force upgrade deps
$ pip install -e csle-attacker --upgrade
# git clone and install from source
git clone https://github.com/Limmen/csle
cd csle/simulation-system/libs/csle-attacker
pip3 install -e .
# Install development dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

### Development tools

Install all development tools at once:
```bash
make install_dev
```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

## API documentation

This section contains instructions for generating API documentation using `sphinx`.

### Latest Documentation

The latest documentation is available at [https://limmen.dev/csle/docs/csle-attacker](https://limmen.dev/csle/docs/csle-attacker)

### Generate API Documentation

First make sure that the `CSLE_HOME` environment variable is set:
```bash
echo $CSLE_HOME
```
Then generate the documentation with the commands:
```bash
cd docs
sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../src/csle_attacker/
make html
```
To update the official documentation at [https://limmen.dev/csle](https://limmen.dev/csle), copy the generated HTML files to the documentation folder:
```bash
cp -r build/html ../../../../docs/_docs/csle-attacker
```

To run all documentation commands at once, use the command:
```bash
make docs
```

## Static code analysis

To run the Python linter, execute the following command:
```
flake8 .
# or (equivalently):
make lint
```

To run the mypy type checker, execute the following command:
```
mypy .
# or (equivalently):
make types
``` 


## Unit tests

To run the unit tests, execute the following command:
```
pytest
# or (equivalently):
make unit_tests
```

To run tests of a specific test suite, execute the following command:
```
pytest -k "ClassName"
```

To generate a coverage report, execute the following command:
```
pytest --cov=csle_attacker
```

## Run tests and code analysis in different python environments

To run tests and code analysis in different python environemnts, execute the following command:

```bash
tox
# or (equivalently):
make tests
```

## Create a new release and publish to PyPi

First build the package by executing:
```bash
python3 -m build
# or (equivalently)
make build
```
After running the command above, the built package is available at `./dist`.

Push the built package to PyPi by running:
```bash
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
# or (equivalently)
make push
```

To run all commands for the release at once, execute:
```bash
make release
```
